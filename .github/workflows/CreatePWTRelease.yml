name: Create GitHub release of PWT

# This workflow for pluggable-widgets-tools:
# 1. Puts current version from package.json as the version for unreleased changes in CHANGELOG.md
# 2. Commits the updates of CHANGELOG.md and pushes the commit to the repo
# 3. Based on the commit it:
#   3.1 Creates a draft GitHub release for PWT.
#   3.2 Creates a merge request that targets CHANGELOG.md updates back to master.
#
#  NOTE: Publishing to npm doesn't happen in this workflow. PublishNpm.yml is responsible fot npm publishing.
#        When the GitHub release is approved, that creates a corresponding git tag to trigger PublishNpm.yml.
